WORK REPORT
-----------
BASIC CONTEXT
- This project is a basic website made with HTML/JavaScript.
- Project was done alone
- git was used as source control
- published on github pages, repository available to the public


TOOLS
* HTML5/CSS3 was used to create the website
* Work was done individually

WEB/DESIGN - PUBLISHING PLACE
* I've used my own web design. Images
have been taken from Wikipedia. 

* Project is published in Github Pages, using Git Bash

VALID HTML/CSS
* CSS and HTML has been checked, both are valid...
- more on this point in the presentation
- tools: W3.org CSS and HTML checkers. 
Used only the CSS3 validator and the HTML5(Experimental) validator

RESPONSIVE DESIGN
* The website uses the meta tag for responsive design.
- initial zoom level is 1 times
- content adjusts based on viewport resolution
- width of the content is determined by this as well
- font size was determined with the viewport in certain sections,
but by checking on other devices, .main font size was left as it is by
default
- max-width property was used to make the images fit for different device sizes
- padding was also added to .home and .header to fill color 
based on device width

USABILITY
* The UI of the website covers some of the 25-point 
usability checklist (https://web.wsu.edu/web-training/usability/website-usability-checklist/25-point-usability-checklist/):

- clear interaction feedback with buttons is available, seen by change
when hovering and clicking
- site is easy to navigate (click a button and content shows up)
- every major part is accessible from the home page
- related topics are located together by putting 
them in a table
- the navigation bar allows easy access to the home page at all times
- the "go back" button allows easy exits from pages
- each webpage covers a certain term, meaning content in it is
mutually exclusive
- labels have simple one or two word descriptions. For example,
titles label the mutually exclusive content in the pages in a row by row basis.
(row 1: page content 1, row 2: page content 2, and so on...)
- Footer clearly shows author, and has a top function, foer going up a page
- Browser window page titles are unique and correlated with the content of the
page
- Headings are used liberally
- paragraphs are short (at most 4 sentences, mostly 2.)
- font size is legible on all devices
