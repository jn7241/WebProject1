	In this website I've listed some computer topics I like talking about.<br>Use the

	<div class = "about">
	<h3 style = "text-decoration:none;">About</h3>
	I've wanted to learn tech since I was a little kid.
	When I was five years old (2008). I learned about the internet. During that time,
	the internet looked differently to how it looked today. Because of that, 
	when I grew up I started to wonder about the history of computing. Looking
	back, it's obvious that computers developed very rapidly and left many things behind.
	This inspired me to talk about some things that happened with the development of computing.
